# The next two sections are for your own benefit. In the highlights you can briefly reflect about your learning experience while working on this activity. After completing the questions in the activity, use this space to write your thoughts about your learning experience. What did you learn working on this assignment? How were you challenged? Was it easy? What did you do that worked? What would you do differently? You can use more than one paragraph but remember to indent the paragraphs. This summary does not need to be very long, try to write it in about 200 words.

    This is my mini-reflection. Paragraphs must be indented.
    
    It can contain multiple paragraphs.
    
# Write the concepts that in your opinion are threshold concepts in this exercise. A threshold concept is a key idea that once you grasp it, it changes your understanding of a topic, phenomenon, subject, method, etc. Write between three and five threshold concepts that apply to your learning experience working on this exercise.
threshold_concepts: 
- threshold concept 1
- threshold concept 2 
- threshold concept 3
- threshold concept 4

## Practice questions

Answer the following questions:

1. What does "Best" in BLUP mean?
2. What is the advantage of kriging over other interpolation approaches?
3. How is the the autocovariance used to produce optimal predictions?

## Learning objectives

In this activity, you will:

1. Conduct variograpic analysis.

2. Use kriging to interpolate a field.

## Preliminaries

Restart `R` to begin work with a new session, or at least clear the working space to ensure that you do not have extraneous items there when you begin your work. The command in R to clear the workspace is `rm` (for "remove"), followed by a list of items to be removed. To clear the workspace from _all_ objects, do the following:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Note that `ls()` lists all objects currently on the workspace.

Load the libraries you will use in this activity (load other packages as appropriate). 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(isdas)
library(gstat)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(stars)
```

Load dataset:
```{r}
data("aquifer")
```

The data is a set of piezometric head (watertable pressure) observations of the Wolfcamp Aquifer in Texas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_head). Measures of pressure can be used to infer the flow of underground water, since water flows from high to low pressure areas.

These data were collected to evaluate potential flow of contamination related to a high level toxic waste repository in Texas. The Deaf Smith county site in Texas was one of three potential sites proposed for this repository. Beneath the site is a deep brine aquifer known as the Wolfcamp aquifer that may serve as a conduit of contamination leaking from the repository.

The data set consists of 85 georeferenced measurements of piezometric head. Possible applications of interpolation are to determine sites at risk and to quantify uncertainty of the interpolated surface, to evaluate the best locations for monitoring stations.

Convert to a `SpatialPointsDataFrame`:
```{r}
aquifer.sf <- aquifer |>
  st_as_sf(coords = c("X", "Y"),
           remove = FALSE)
```

## Activity

::: {.textbox data-latex=""}
**Capstone Activity**

This is a capstone activity where you can work free-style
on a data set of your choice, and put in practice what you
have learned with respect to the analysis of spatially continuous/
field data.
:::

1. Partner with a fellow student to analyze the dataset provided.

2. Use kriging to interpolate the underlying field. Justify your modeling choices.

3. Discuss your results.

4. Imagine that you had to compare different modeling approaches (e.g., kriging, IDW). Propose a protocol to decide which method is more accurate.
