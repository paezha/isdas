# The next two sections are for your own benefit. In the highlights you can briefly reflect about your learning experience while working on this activity. After completing the questions in the activity, use this space to write your thoughts about your learning experience. What did you learn working on this assignment? How were you challenged? Was it easy? What did you do that worked? What would you do differently? You can use more than one paragraph but remember to indent the paragraphs. This summary does not need to be very long, try to write it in about 200 words.

    This is my mini-reflection. Paragraphs must be indented.
    
    It can contain multiple paragraphs.
    
# Write the concepts that in your opinion are threshold concepts in this exercise. A threshold concept is a key idea that once you grasp it, it changes your understanding of a topic, phenomenon, subject, method, etc. Write between three and five threshold concepts that apply to your learning experience working on this exercise.
threshold_concepts: 
- threshold concept 1
- threshold concept 2 
- threshold concept 3
- threshold concept 4

## Practice questions

Answer the following questions:

1. What is a key difference between area data and point data?
2. What is a choropleth map?
3. What is a cartogram?
4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these mapping techniques?

## Learning objectives

In this activity, you will:

1. Create choroplet maps using census data.
2. Think about possible underlying process that could explain the pattern.
3. Think about ways to decide whether a landscape is random when working with area data.

## Suggested reading

## Preliminaries

It is good practice to clear the working space to make sure that you do not have extraneous items there when you begin your work. The command in R to clear the workspace is `rm` (for "remove"), followed by a list of items to be removed. To clear the workspace from _all_ objects, do the following:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Note that `ls()` lists all objects currently on the workspace.

Load the libraries you will use in this activity. 

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need `sf`, a package that implements simple features in R (you can learn more about this package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html)):
```{r ch20-load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(cartogram)
library(isdas)
```

In the practice that preceded this activity, you learned about the area data and visualization techniques for area data.

Begin by loading the data that you will use in this activity:
```{r}
data("Hamilton_CT")
```

This is an `sf` object with census tracts and selected demographic variables for the Hamilton CMA in Canada.

You can obtain new (calculated) variables as follows. For instance, to obtain the proportion of residents who are between 20 and 34 years old, and between 35 and 49:
```{r}
Hamilton_CT <- Hamilton_CT %>%
  mutate(Prop20to34 = (AGE_20_TO_24 + 
                         AGE_25_TO_29 + 
                         AGE_30_TO_34)/POPULATION, 
         Prop35to49 = (AGE_35_TO_39 + 
                         AGE_40_TO_44 + 
                         AGE_45_TO_49)/POPULATION)
```

You are ready for the next activity.

## Activity

**NOTE**: Activities include technical "how to" tasks/questions (indicated with *). Usually, these ask you to practice using the software to organize data, create plots, and so on in support of analysis and interpretation. The second type of questions ask you to activate your brainware and to think geographically and statistically.

1. (*) Create choropleth maps for the proportion of the population who are 20 to 34 years old, 35 to 49 years old, 50 to 65 years old, and 65 and older.

2. (*) Create cartograms for the proportion of the population who are 20 to 34 years old, 35 to 49 years old, 50 to 65 years old, and 65 and older.

3. (*) Change the scheme and colors of your maps to obtain maps with 2 classes/colors, 5 classes/colors, and 10 classes/colors. You can check different color palettes [in the documentation of {ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html). Which scheme is more informative? What colors looked better to you?

4. Show your maps to a fellow student. What patterns do you notice in the distribution of population by age in Hamilton? Do you think the distribution of the population by age is random, or not random?

5. Devise a rule to decide whether the pattern observed in a choropleth map is random.
