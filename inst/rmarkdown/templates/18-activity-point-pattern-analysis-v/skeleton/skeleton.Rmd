# The next two sections are for your own benefit. In the highlights you can briefly reflect about your learning experience while working on this activity. After completing the questions in the activity, use this space to write your thoughts about your learning experience. What did you learn working on this assignment? How were you challenged? Was it easy? What did you do that worked? What would you do differently? You can use more than one paragraph but remember to indent the paragraphs. This summary does not need to be very long, try to write it in about 200 words.

    This is my mini-reflection. Paragraphs must be indented.
    
    It can contain multiple paragraphs.
    
# Write the concepts that in your opinion are threshold concepts in this exercise. A threshold concept is a key idea that once you grasp it, it changes your understanding of a topic, phenomenon, subject, method, etc. Write between three and five threshold concepts that apply to your learning experience working on this exercise.
threshold_concepts: 
- threshold concept 1
- threshold concept 2 
- threshold concept 3
- threshold concept 4

## Practice questions

Answer the following questions:

1. Describe the process to use simulation for hypothesis testing
2. Why is the selection of an appropriate region critical for the analysis of point patterns?
3. Discuss the issues associated with the edges of a region.
4. What is a sampled point pattern?

## Learning objectives

In this activity, you will:

1. Explore a dataset using single scale distance-based techniques.
2. Explore the characteristics of a point pattern at multiple scales.
3. Discuss ways to evaluate how confident you are that a pattern is random.

## Preliminaries

It is good practice to clear the working space to make sure that you do not have extraneous items there when you begin your work. The command in R to clear the workspace is `rm` (for "remove"), followed by a list of items to be removed. To clear the workspace from _all_ objects, do the following:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Note that `ls()` lists all objects currently on the workspace.

Load the libraries you will use in this activity. In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need `spatstat`, a package designed for the analysis of point patterns (you can learn about `spatstat` [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/vignettes/getstart.pdf) and [here](http://spatstat.org/resources/spatstatJSSpaper.pdf)):
```{r message=FALSE}
library(isdas)
library(spatstat)
library(tidyverse)
```

Load a dataset of your choice. It could be one of the datasets that we have used before (Toronto Business Points, Bear GPS Locations), or one of the datasets included with the package `spatstat`. To see what datasets are available through the package, do the following:
```{r}
vcdExtra::datasets("spatstat.data")
```

Load a dataset of your choice.

You can do this by using the `load()` function if the dataset is in your drive (e.g., the GPS coordinates of the bear).

On the other hand, if the dataset is included with the `spatstat` package you can do the following, for example to load the `gorillas` dataset:
```{r}
gorillas.ppp <- gorillas
```

As usual, you can check the object by means of the `summary` function:
```{r}
summary(gorillas.ppp)
```

## Activity

**Capstone Activity**

This is a capstone activity where you can work free-style on a data set of your choice, and put in practice what you
have learned with respect to the analysis of point patterns.

1. Partner with a fellow student to analyze the chosen dataset.

2. Discuss whether the pattern is random, and how confident you are in your decision.

3. The analysis of the pattern is meant to provide insights about the underlying process. Create a hypothesis using the data generated and can you answer that hypothesis using the plots generated?

4. Discuss the limitations of the analysis, for instance, choice of modeling parameters (size of region, kernel bandwidths, edge effects, etc.)
