The variables are as follows:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item x. x points based on a false origin and normalized to the unit-square  (0.01698944--0.95718825)
\item y. y points based on a false origin and normalized to the unit-square  (0.01003585--0.98715473)
\item VAR1. Genric variable - think of it as housing prices or concentrations in ppb of some contaminant (50.00000--1050.00000)
\item VAR2. Genric variable - think of it as housing prices or concentrations in ppb of some contaminant (50.00000--1050.00000)
\item VAR3. Genric variable - think of it as housing prices or concentrations in ppb of some contaminant (50.00000--1050.00000)
\item Observed. factor variable states whether the variables were measured for a location: if the status is "FALSE", the values of the variables are missing (TRUE--FALSE)
